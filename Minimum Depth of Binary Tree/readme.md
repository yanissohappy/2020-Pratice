Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

* Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

## Example:

	Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

		    3
		   / \
		  9  20
		    /  \
		   15   7
